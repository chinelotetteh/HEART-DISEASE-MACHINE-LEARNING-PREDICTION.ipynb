**Project Name:** Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

**Project Overview:** 

This repository contains a comprehensive machine-learning project aimed at predicting the likelihood of heart disease in patients using clinical and lifestyle data. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualizations, model development, and performance evaluation of multiple classifiers.

**Objective:** The purpose of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the presence of heart disease based on patient demographics, medical history and test results.

**Dataset:** Features include 13 attributes related to patient demographics, medical history and diagnostic results.

The target variable is a binary classification (1 = Presence of heart disease, 0 = No heart disease).

**Tools and Libraries:**

- Python

- Pandas, NumPy (Data Manipulation)

- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualizations)

- Scikit-learn (Model Development & Evaluation)

- Jupyter Notebook

 **Methodology:** This project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook and follows a systematic machine-learning pipeline:

- Data Preprocessing: Data inspection, handling missing values and duplicates, feature scaling by standardizing the continuous features, checking dataset structure, statistical summaries and feature selection.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Distribution of target variable, correlation heatmap, histograms and pairplots, feature importance.

- Model Development & Evaluation: Splitting of dataset into training set and testing set, training and evaluation of 3 machine learnong models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest.

- Performance Metrics: Using the following metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC

- Model Comparison

- Visualizations

**Future Work:**

Explore advanced models (XGBoost, LightGBM).

Deploy the best model using Flask or FastAPI.
